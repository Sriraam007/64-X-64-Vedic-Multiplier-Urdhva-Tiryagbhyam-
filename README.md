# 64 X 64 bit Vedic Multiplier (Urdhva Tiryagbhyam)

Vedic mathematics, particularly the Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra, presents a scalable approach to multiplication that reduces computational complexity. This paper investigates the design and implementation of a 64-bit Vedic multiplier utilizing the Urdhva Tiryagbhyam method, with a focus on evaluating its performance when combined with a modified full adder architecture. Two proposed full
adders, with different logic optimizations, replaces conventional adder components. This work provides an in-depth analysis of the impact of this architectural modification on the overall performance
of the multiplier, highlighting key metrics such as technology view and hardware utility. The findings offer insights into the potential of this combined approach in enhancing arithmetic operations in advanced digital systems.
